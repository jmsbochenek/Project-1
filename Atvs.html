<p>My whole life I have been interested in vehicles.</p>
<p>I first started out with working on cars when I first got my license.</p>
<p>After cars I got into atv's and started doing trail riding.</p>
<p>The atv shown above is a Yamaha YFZ 450.</p>
<p>This specific atv is used for mostly racing, but can be used for trail riding as well.</p>
<img src="kfx.jpg">
<p>This atv is a kawasaki KFX 450.</p>
<p>Just like the Yamaha, this atv is used for racing, but is good for trails as well.</p>
<p>What makes this atv better for trails, is that it has a reverse gear.</p>
